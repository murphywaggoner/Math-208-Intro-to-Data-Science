The idea behind a Case Study Assignment is to have all students in the class read/view the
case study, but one group of students would present on the case study.

- What is the question to be answered?

- What is the dataset?

- Describe in detail a specific method used.

- Does the case study use the tidyverse?

    - If not, could you understand the code?  Could you rewrite the code to use the tidyverse?
    
    - If so, did the case study use the tidyverse in the way we would?

- Describe something you learned that was new.

- What is one piece of advice/whatever that you learned that you think is most important?

## La Quinta

A well-developed case study on scraping the web for data for La Quinta Hotels 
and Denny's Restaurants to see the geographical relationship between these companies.

## Irises

The dataset iris has been analyzed by many people, but this case study lays out
the analysis beginning with a good look at the data.

## Flights

This case study attempts to answer questions about flight data similar to what we have used in class.

## Internal Positioning System

A more sophistocated case study on using an indoor position system to predict locations.  The case study changes the shape of the data and uses a model to understand the data that
we don't use in our class.  Chapter 1 from **Data Science in R: A Case Studies Approach
to Computational Reasoning and Problems Solving** by Deborah Nolan and Duncan Temple Lang.
