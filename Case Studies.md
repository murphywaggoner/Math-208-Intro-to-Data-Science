The idea behind a Case Study Assignment is to have all students in the class read/view the
case study, but one group of students would present on the case study.

- What is the question to be answered?

- What is the dataset?

- Describe in detail a specific method used.

- Describe something you learned that was new.

- What is one piece of advice/whatever that you learned that you think is most important?
